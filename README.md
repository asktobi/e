# e / edit 

	A text editor

## Goals
	
	- multiple files
	- git integration
	- on-the-fly scripting (not unlike vim)
	- pinable lines
	- syntax highlighting

## dir structure 

	
	- bin:         Binarys are stored here, if u wanna test ur programm before u install it with \"make install\" go here.	
	- src:         Here the source code is stored.
	- hdr:         This is the directroy for header files, library's and other sources of functions ^^.
	- ast:         All none Programming related assets (Pictures, Audio, ... anything really).
	- README.md:   This is a description of the Project, its goals, installation and building instructions in the markup language R.
	               If your reading this on github.com u are reading this file ^^.
	- Makefile:    This is for the Projects Makefile, edit this if you want to change the $COMPILER, $LINKER, $MAIN (resulting Binary) or just the general setup.
	               A Makefile tutorial: coming soon ... (When i google it ^^)
